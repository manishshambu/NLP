ID-0895	I hate that motel is cheap noisy very load barly change sheets, ppl tent to break into cars and they barly do anything bout it just sucks...

ID-0953	When I checked into the hotel, I was informed the elevator was not working. I had to truck up the stairs, with my luggage, by self. I was provided no help from the staff. The air conditioner was broken, which created a very stuffy room. When I took a shower, the stopper was stuck shut, so by the end of the shower, the water was almost overflowing.

ID-1094	The Place Inn in Oxnard, CA is a perfect place to stay if you are traveling up the coast of California. The rates range form $25 to $40 a night. Each room has a microwave and a fridge so you can keep all the snacks you want right in your room. The twon of Oxnard is quiet and scenic so you can relax all of your vacation. Some of the rooms also have a large spa that you can relax in. The staff is helpful and room service is always on time.

ID-0909	I booked a weekend at Terranea for my birthday. When I arrived my room was not ready at my check-in time and I was told I would have to wait. The front desk did not provide me an exact time but said I could walk around. An hour later it was still not ready. It took 5 hours actually. The next day at the pool a server came around and took my order while I laid out. They never returned. When I approached the pool bar it was mess. The sink was clogged and cups were everywhere. The price I paid made me really expect more. It should be a 2 star not 4.5. I won't be returning.

ID-1194	My wife, two-year old son and I stayed at La Quinta Inn in Garland, Texas during our vacation this Spring Break. The staff was very nice and accomodating. They quickly brought up a crib for our son soon after we requested one. The room was clean and very spacious. Our bed was also comfortable. A great breakfast came free with the stay. They offered scrambled eggs, waffles, cereals, pastries, and much more. We had a great stay here. It only cost us about $80 a night.

ID-1264	I recently went to the Aulani Resort and Spa for a staycation for 3 days. Our party consisted of 3 females and 3 males all between the ages of 25 and 30 and we all found the hotel a great place to spend a few days to relax and be a kid again. We had breakfast with Hawaiian themed Disney characters such as Goofy, Mickey, and Minnie which was fun. Playing in the large pool and relaxing in the man-made creek was a great place to be. 3 in our party went to the spa and all came back relaxed and refreshed while my girlfriend, her friend and I went to play on the water slides and generally have a good time. The setting of the hotel is beautiful beside a salt water lagoon. The night before we left we had a delicious dinner at the Ama'ama restaurant. It was sad to get back to reality once we finished.

ID-1007	I recently stayed at the Aliante Station Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a regular guest at Red Rock Station Casino, their sister property. I was enticed to stay at Aliante because of a deep discount they were offering. However, our experience was so bad that the hotel should have paid US! The directions on the hotel's website were outdated. The route took at least half an hour longer than if they had taken another freeway. We finally arrived and got up to our room. Despite opening less than a year ago, our room had many things broken or missing. Lights were burnt out, the television remote did not work unless we sat one inch in front of the television, our bathroom toiler paper holder was ripped from the wall and the sink water pressure was horrendous. They also forgot to stock our minibar, despite checking in much later than the usual arrival time. We tried to ignore the poorly-maintained room by dining and gambling downstairs. We first tried their cafe. The service was horribly slow and the food was tasteless. We next tried their Pancake House. The food was covered in vinegar and was disgusting. After those two meals, we drove to the nearest grocery store and prepared the remainder of our meals in the room or ate at restaurants off of the property. I shared my complaints with the reservation agent upon checking out and he did not seem to care. I will never stay at this location again!

ID-1270	This hotel and resort is wonderful for family events. The three pools are an added bonus. There are many activities to enjoy year round.

ID-1246	The San Francisco Marriot at Union Square is an amazing hotel. I stayed there for three days during the summer of 2011. First of all the location of the hotel in Union Square is great because of all the shops and restaurants nearby and because of its proximity to many interesting San Francisco hot spots. When I entered the hotel I was greeted by the receptionist who had my reservation ready and who offered me many ideas as to what to do in the city whenever I left the hotel. My room was spectacular and had a nice big window in which I could see Union Square and all the commotion going on the street, which is nice when you're in a big city and can see all the city lights. The beds were nice and clean which is always a big concern of mine and the bathroom was equipped with many towels and toiletries, which was also really nice. There is absolutely nothing I can complain about seeing as the location, the hotel amenities, and my room were all wonderful. I would definitely stay there again.

ID-1232	i recently visited The W hotel in New Orleans(downtown)for the first time and it was best hotel ive ever been too. First of all, the hotel is beautiful!! The valet is prompt and courteous. I was even given a bottle of Voss water upon entrance...for free!! The check-in girl was polite and gave me a free room upgrade. My room was immaculate and beautifully decorated. later that night i ordered room service and the food was hot and fresh. i requested a wake up call the next morning and i did receive it on the dot.  Checkout was a breeze and so was retrieval of my vehicle. overall, i give this hotel two thumbs up!

ID-0883	My stay at the Jameson Inn in Lafayette, LA was absolutely horrible. The room was dirty and antiquated. The walls must have been paper thin as I heard every other guest in the entire building. Additionally, guests were venturing in at all hours of the night and I was unable to sleep at all due to the noise. The staff was not friendly and refused to address any of my complaints. I would never stay here again.

ID-1025	I have stayed at The Inn At The Convention Center for a total of one week on separate occasions. First, if you can get past the curt responses of the near inhuman clerks in the front office, you will make your way into one of the worst hotel experiences of your life. Taking a trip in the elevator feels as if it will be your last. It is squeaky, smells strongly of cleaning detergents, and runs slowly. Once you arrive on your floor, the smell of cleaning agents is even stronger than the smell of the elevator. It buries itself into one's pores and haunts your entire stay. As for the location, it's true that the Inn At The Convention Center is near major freeways and minutes from downtown, but the area it's located in is terrible, offering nothing in the way of good food or culture. It is a haven for young party animals, noise included. Additionally, the wi-fi is terrible, if and when it works at all.You would be better off saving your money for a different hotel in a different location. You won't be sorry you did.

ID-1023	I really didn't like how cheap this motel was. It was somewhat shabby and not very nice sometimes to stay in the main building and was somewhat dark. The place didn't offer as much as I really wanted from a motel.

ID-1124	The Ocean Creek Resort in Myrtle Beach is the Best!The Hotel is situated on the water in Myrtle Beach and has several pools for both adults and children. Because of the location near a creek the water is great for little children. The rooms are spacious and bright. the staff is very friendly and accommodating to your needs. The ocean side bar is perfect for sitting back and listening to music.

ID-1130	On my last vacation, I decided I wanted to go to a place that was quaint and quiet, but still had a suitable level of culture to partake in. This place turned out to be Charleston, SC. After doing research on hotels in the area, I decided on the Planters Inn on Market Street, a quite luxurious hotel for the area featuring a 4-star dining experience. Upon reaching the hotel the staff was friendly and greeted me warmly. Check-in was a breeze and soon I was off to my king room accommodations. Outside the room was a little round, iron-wrought table set for two overlooking the courtyard. The tall white columns were freshly washed and looked new and fresh plants were out. (The weather was a bit dreary the entire time, so I didn't get to enjoy that feature of the hotel very much.) Once inside with my luggage, the first thing I noticed was a card with my name on it and a teddy bear in the middle of my ginormous bed. The card welcomed me and the bear ultimately became a keepsake for my nephew. The bedroom was beautiful, and the bathroom was just as nice. The first thing I did was take a nice long, hot bath in the jacuzzi. It was the perfect way to unwind after my drive from Atlanta where I'd just barely fled some unseasonable snow. After the bath, I ordered the duck from the 4-star Peninsula Grill and a glass of champagne. It was my first vacation in almost a decade and I planned to live it up! My stay lasted a week, and all in all, each day was the a slightly different rendition of the first. Between sightseeing, visiting shops for gifts and keepsakes, and hitting up a few bead shops for my jewelry line on Etsy, I got to relax in some of the most luxurious accommodations I have ever had the pleasure of partaking in. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers, were all friendly and quick to answer any request. (Once I saw a bellman delivering chocolate covered strawberries that were not on the menu, he made sure I got some too!) It was a fabulous hotel and a place I plan to visit again in the future. Thanks Planters Inn!

ID-1052	I recently stayed at the Marriott Beachside Hotel in Key West, the one right off the roadway when you first get into town. It was pure luxury, and has its own private beach, with small boat rentals right there on the property. They have private cabana rentals and a poolside tiki bar. The restaurant is amazing and you can watch the chefs preparing everything right there from your table. It's a little ways from the main action in Key West, but they provide a free shuttle that runs every few minutes and drops you off right on the main strip, in front of the Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville restaurant. It's much quieter to stay off the main strip, and you don't have to worry about parking or driving if you've been partying. And who doesn't party when they go to Key West??

ID-0929	When I visited this hotel, I thought everything was going to be great. It's appearance was not too shabby, but as soon as I got to the room, my opinion began to change. The room was nowhere near the quality that the rest of the hotel was; it only came with the basics, and nothing more. I would have expected more from a nicer hotel. The other surprising thing about this hotel was the staff. I did not feel secure at all. When I first came to my room to find my wife, she was not there (and I did not have a key). I simply came to the door, knocked, and waited one second. The maid down the hall came over and let me in the room. I could have been some stranger that was knocking on someone's room! I will not go back to that hotel because of this safety issue. Thank you.

ID-0917	Super 8 was a hotel I recently stayed at due to lack of other options. As far as hotels go, they were untidy, service was slow and the overall experience was horrible. The room I got has bed sheets strewn all over the place, and no room keeping person had bothered to clean the room after the previous person had left. The service was slow and it took an unreasonable amount of time to get a simple makeshift bed brought to our room. Overall, a horrible experience that was a waste of money.

ID-1042	On a cross-country trip, hubby and I decided to stop overnight at this hotel. Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by the front desk and check-in was prompt and quick.  We went to our economy room and quickly found the bathroom facilities were not in working order. The front desk promptly upgraded our room for no charge (although there were many economy rooms still available). After a quick room change we went to check out the pool and hot tub area. The area was clean and well stocked with chairs and towels (and as a bonus, we were the only ones there). The pool was cool and clear, and the hot tup warm. After a quick dip we headed back to our room to enjoy the king size bed, huge flat screen TV, and premium cable. Our stay was very comfortable and no complaints about bed, bedding, or showering facilities.  The continental breakfast was superb. There was fresh fruit, cereal, eggs, and make-your-own waffles. We left filling full, refreshed, and ready for the last leg of our trip. I would recommended this hotel for anyone looking for a nicer hotel on your weekend trip.

ID-0875	Although it was very cheap, this hotel still wasn't worth the money. The sink didn't work, there was no toilet paper, and the room was in dire need of repair. Dents and stains on the wall were unsightly and even with all the locks on the door, the people standing around all day outside my room made me feel uneasy. I would not recommend this hotel.
